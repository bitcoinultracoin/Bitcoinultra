Development process
===========================

Because of the power hungry ASIC mining hardware, Bitcoin Mining is now Consuming More Electricity Than 159 Countries Including Ireland & Most Countries In Africa. It does not have to be that way. With Bitcoinultra and its Proof-of-Staking algorithm and it barely uses more energy than just leaving the computer on.

Bitcoin Ultra (BTCU) uses the proof of stake technology which is thousand times more cost effective than proof of work system. 
In proof of work system, miners validate transactions and creates new blocks by performing a certain amount of computational work which require powerful mining equipment. 
Bitcoinultra uses proof of stake, which requires the user to show ownership of a certain amount of coins to validate a transaction, it does not require any special mining equipment.
 This gives ordinary users a fair opportunity to earn coins. Every user who wishes to validate a transaction can stake and in return receive coins as reward.
